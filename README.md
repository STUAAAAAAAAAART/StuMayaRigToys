# StuMayaRigToys
Small rigging stuff in maya: contains scripts to rig small parts, and other small proofs of concepts

Also a repo that's a better curated selection of rigging operation scripts and stuff i've created and strewn about around my github repos

this repo is currently being heavily edited as it is being under active development
